# SwiftUIiPad - Swift UI code for Simple iPad App

* Main Screen: Logo on top of the screen (centered) with six square (rounded corner) images below it in a 3x2 layout (the application is intended to be run in landscape mode on an iPad 10.2inch screen)

* Clicking on the company logo on top will start a full-screen video playing that loops indefinitely

* For navigation, swiping right on the video will return to the previous (main) screen

* Clicking on the images will lead to different URLs (some will be youtube videos, some will be web hosted articles) to be viewed fullscreen without a browser navigation bar

* For navigation on these pages, swiping right on the page will return to the previous (main) screen

* The background color for the app should be another of our brandâ€™s color that is almost black (Hex: #191919) (RGB: 25, 25, 25) (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 95)
